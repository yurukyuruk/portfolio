              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>The project focused on designing a user-friendly interface for a language-learning app that integrates 
                <span>augmented reality (AR)</span> and <span>gamification</span> to enhance engagement. The app enables 
                users to interact with real-world objects, practice vocabulary in context, and participate in interactive 
                challenges to reinforce learning. The target audience includes individuals aged 18-35 who seek an immersive 
                and motivating way to learn new languages using digital tools.

              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>
                Traditional language-learning apps often lack engagement and fail to provide immersive learning experiences. 
                Many focus on passive learning methods, such as flashcards and repetitive exercises, which do not simulate 
                real-life interactions. Additionally, existing solutions do not effectively incorporate AR technology, leaving 
                a gap in providing interactive, context-based learning. These limitations reduce user motivation and hinder 
                long-term retention.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="solution-part">
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>
                To address these challenges, the app was designed with a strong focus on <span>interaction</span>, 
                <span>personalization</span>, and <span>real-world application</span>. By integrating AR, users can learn 
                vocabulary and sentence structures by scanning objects in their environment. Gamification elements, such as 
                challenges and rewards, keep users motivated. Through usability testing, design improvements were made to ensure 
                intuitive navigation and seamless user interaction. The final product offers an engaging, immersive, and effective 
                way to learn languages through innovative technology.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                After analyzing various language-learning apps on the market, such as <span>Duolingo</span> and <span>Falou</span>,
                we assessed their strengths and weaknesses. Our findings indicated a demand for a more interactive and immersive learning 
                experience that incorporates real-world applications. A key pain point identified was the <span>lack of engagement</span> 
                in traditional apps, which rely heavily on passive learning rather than interactive and gamified methods.
            </p>
            <p class="research-section-second-paragraph">
                To further explore user behaviors and preferences, we conducted interviews with language learners (ages 18-35). We then 
                analyzed responses using Miro brainstorming board, grouping insights into key themes:

                    <h3><span class="diamond-bullet">⟣</span> Languages</h3>
                    <p>Users prefer short, daily learning sessions but struggle with pronunciation and dialects. Many supplement app-based
                        learning with TV series, online courses, and tutoring to improve their skills.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><span class="diamond-bullet">⟣</span> Technology</h3>
                    <p>Most participants are familiar with mobile learning apps but have limited experience with AR-based education. Users 
                        see the potential of AR for interactive learning, but they need it to be intuitive and practical.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><span class="diamond-bullet">⟣</span> Games & Motivation</h3>
                    <p>Gamification drives engagement, with competition (rankings, challenges) and cooperation (group tasks) being the most
                         effective motivators. Users find traditional learning apps lack interactive, game-based experiences that make 
                         learning fun.
                    </p>
                </li>

            <p class="research-section-last-paragraph">
                Our research confirmed the need for a more immersive, gamified approach to language learning by integrating AR and real-world 
                interactions. To enhance motivation, we incorporated leaderboards, challenges, and interactive tasks. AR-based learning 
                improves vocabulary retention, while multimedia integration supports better pronunciation and dialect training, creating a 
                more engaging and effective experience.

                    Our design follows a modern, user-friendly aesthetic, ensuring clarity, accessibility, and engagement. The typography 
                    is based on the <span>Nunito</span> font, providing a clean and readable structure with distinct styles for headings, paragraphs, 
                    and captions. The color palette includes <span>deep purples</span> as primary colors, complemented by <span>vibrant green</span> 
                    and <span>orange</span> secondary colors, creating a bold, energetic contrast that enhances visibility while maintaining a polished, professional 
                    look. Neutral tones of black and white provide balance and readability. <span>The Material Symbols icon set</span> enhances the interface
                    with minimalistic, recognizable icons, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience. This cohesive design system 
                    prioritizes accessibility, usability, and aesthetics, creating an engaging and visually appealing interface that supports 
                    seamless interaction.
