            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The project involved designing a user interface for an event application called <span>Eventful</span>, 
              which aimed to enhance user engagement by connecting individuals with shared interests. 
              The app allows users to create, discover, and manage events based on personal preferences. 
              It also provides users with tools to make reservations and efficiently manage their schedules. 
              The target audience includes individuals looking for a streamlined experience in finding and 
              attending events that cater to their personal interests.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Existing event management apps often suffer from poor navigation and a lack of user-centered features, 
              leading to a frustrating user experience. Users found it difficult to find relevant events or manage 
              them effectively due to complicated filtering systems and limited customization options. Additionally, 
              key features such as event creation, profile management, and participation tracking were either missing 
              or difficult to use. These issues diminished user engagement and discouraged people from using such platforms 
              regularly.

          <div class="solution-part">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
              To solve these issues, the Eventful app was designed with a focus on <span>simplicity</span> and <span>usability</span>. 
              A clean, modern design with a strong emphasis on personalization allows users to easily navigate the app and find events 
              that align with their interests. Key improvements included intuitive navigation, comprehensive filtering options, 
              and detailed event management features. Usability testing played a critical role in identifying pain points, 
              such as inconsistent button designs and the lack of certain features (e.g., calendar integration and event host 
              information), leading to iterative improvements. The final product includes event creation tools, personalized 
              recommendations, and the ability to manage event participation with ease. This approach ensured that the app not 
              only addressed the user pain points but also delivered a user-friendly, engaging experience.

                  creating distinct styles for headings and body text. The color palette, featuring vibrant orange and deep teal, was chosen to create a bold,
