            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The project involved designing a user interface for an event application called <span>Eventful</span>, 
              which aimed to enhance user engagement by connecting individuals with shared interests. 
              The app allows users to create, discover, and manage events based on personal preferences. 
              It also provides users with tools to make reservations and efficiently manage their schedules. 
              The target audience includes individuals looking for a streamlined experience in finding and 
              attending events that cater to their personal interests.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Existing event management apps often suffer from poor navigation and a lack of user-centered features, 
              leading to a frustrating user experience. Users found it difficult to find relevant events or manage 
              them effectively due to complicated filtering systems and limited customization options. Additionally, 
              key features such as event creation, profile management, and participation tracking were either missing 
              or difficult to use. These issues diminished user engagement and discouraged people from using such platforms 
              regularly.

          <div class="solution-part">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
              To solve these issues, the Eventful app was designed with a focus on <span>simplicity</span> and <span>usability</span>. 
              A clean, modern design with a strong emphasis on personalization allows users to easily navigate the app and find events 
              that align with their interests. Key improvements included intuitive navigation, comprehensive filtering options, 
              and detailed event management features. Usability testing played a critical role in identifying pain points, 
              such as inconsistent button designs and the lack of certain features (e.g., calendar integration and event host 
              information), leading to iterative improvements. The final product includes event creation tools, personalized 
              recommendations, and the ability to manage event participation with ease. This approach ensured that the app not 
              only addressed the user pain points but also delivered a user-friendly, engaging experience.

            After analyzing various event apps on the market, such as <span>Meetup</span> and <span>Eventbrite</span>, we assessed their strengths and weaknesses.

          <h2>Iteration and Finalization</h2>
          <div>
            <p>We refined the design based on usability testing results and finalized the prototype. Here are the changes we made:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Redesigned primary buttons to be more visually distinct, enhancing user recognition and interaction.</li>
              <li>Implemented features to add event prices to enhance functionality and user engagement.</li>
              <li>Provided an option to add reserved events on Google Calendar to allow users to easily add events to their personal schedules.</li>
              <li>Evaluated the necessity of the burger menu and considered removing it.</li>
              <li>Added more specific filter options, such as times and places, to help users find events that meet their exact preferences.</li>
              <li>Displayed the host's name on event details to provide more context and information for users.</li>
              <li>Included a notification or indicator showing that a user has already joined an event.</li>
              <li>Showed the maximum number of participants for each event and indicate when an event is full.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
            <p>The final prototype incorporated all feedback, resulting in a user-friendly, feature-rich application that met user needs and
            preferences.
